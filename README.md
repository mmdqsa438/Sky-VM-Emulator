## Bubble Operating System and Sky Machine Virtual CPU

Sky Machine is a university-level educational project simulating a virtual machine environment on Windows.  
This virtual machine runs a minimalist Operating System called **Bubble**, implemented using a unique assembly-like programming language designed specifically for this platform.

---

## Project Overview

- The virtual machine architecture simulates memory, registers, hard disk, and CPU operation logic fully implemented in C.  
- It supports a custom assembly-like language with concise syntax for programming the virtual CPU.  
- This is a single-threaded virtual CPU capable of executing only one program at a time.

---

## How It Works

1. Simulates virtual hardware components including registers and memory heaps.  
2. Uses a unique low-level programming language with instructions similar to assembly for system and user-level programming.  
3. Provides facilities for arithmetic, logical, control flow, I/O, and file operations in the custom language.  
4. Maintains separate memory spaces for OS (Bubble) and user programs, switching execution context accordingly.
